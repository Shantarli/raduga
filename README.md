# RADUGA

Raduga is a relatively simple application written using the Phoenix framework in the Elixir language. It was made primarily for training purposes, but I hope some of you will find it useful and entertaining.

It's kind of like —Åhristmas garland or a strobe light for your event. It's something that can help you create an atmosphere, especially if you pick the right music. Just create a room, add colors to it with a given rate of change, and then everything will work automatically. All color changes are displayed synchronously to everyone in the room. Endlessly, in a loop.

Keyboard shortcuts also available.
